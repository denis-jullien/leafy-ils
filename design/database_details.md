SQLModel allows us to access database through Python classes based on Pydantic format.

### Database's tables relationship

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Book[(Book)]
    Author[(Author)]
    BorrowHistory[(BorrowHistory)]
    FamilyMember[(FamilyMember)]
    Family[(Family)]

    Book --author--> Author
    Author --book--> Book
    BorrowHistory --book--> Book
    Book --borrow_history--> BorrowHistory
    BorrowHistory --member--> FamilyMember
    FamilyMember --borrow_history--> BorrowHistory

    Family --members--> FamilyMember
    FamilyMember --family--> Family
    Family --family_referent--> FamilyMember
    FamilyMember --referent_of_family--> Family
```

- Book and Author will be used to make the catalog
- each adhesion is made by Family
- each Family is composed of at least one FamilyMember as referent
- Book and Family need to shared a BorrowHistory

### Python classes

class Book{
    id: int [optional]
